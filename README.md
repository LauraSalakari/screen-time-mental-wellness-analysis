# Screen Time and General Wellbeing

This research and analysis, with the help of the *Screen Time vs Mental Wellness Survey* conducted in 2025, attempts to understand the effect of screen time on different parts of personal wellbeing. We explore this through three key components: sleep, mental wellbeing, and productivity.

By the end of our analysis, we will have answered three questions:
1. How does screen time affect the amount and quality of sleep?
2. How does screen time affect productivity?
3. How does screen time impact general mental wellness?

Through the answers to these questions, we can draw conclusions on the general wellbeing in relation to screen time 
presented in the dataset
